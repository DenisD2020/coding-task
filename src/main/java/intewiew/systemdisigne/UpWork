Design a new service that will provide a $100 Amazon Gift Card to freelancers once they've worked for the first 100 hours.
Background: when freelancers are working on Upwork, they can bill clients for the number of hours worked. Hours can be added manually
via the Work Diary or automatically via the Upwork Time Tracker app. Either way, the source of truth for those records
is the "workTracker" service. For reference, there are about 1 million active freelancers currently registered on Upwork.
